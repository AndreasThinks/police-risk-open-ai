police-risk-open-ai
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This library records my experimentation with LLMs, the OpenAI API, and
examining how they perform in police-like risk assessments.

## Install

``` sh
pip install police_risk_open_ai
```

Amend the `example.env` file included in this repo, using an API key
from OpenAI, and save this as a new file, `.env`

## How to use

You can use
[`query_llm`](https://AndreasThinks.github.io/police-risk-open-ai/llm.html#query_llm)
to query the API.

``` python
query_llm('Where does it rain in Spain?')
```

    '\n\nRainfall in Spain is'
