<p>This core notebook is intended to do reading and querying from OpenAI api, once you’ve obtained your domain data using the code from <code>police_risk_open_ai.core.crawl</code></p>
<p>To run OpenAI, you’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>the openai python library</li>
<li>an API key, saved as an environment variable</li>
</ul>

For now I’m mostly copying this <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings">OpenAI tutorial</a>.

<p>Before we can begin analysis, we need to split our text into <code>tokens</code>, recognisable chunks of text-data our model will recognise.</p>
<p>That’s it! We’ve converted our entire library to arrays, and you can see each document converted into our series of datapoints. I’ll export that code into a function.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="questions">Questions!</h2>
<p>With our embedding process completed, let’s convert them to Numpy arrays.</p>
<p>We’re now back and close to following the tutorial. The approach is actually quite clever: we use the embeddings to find documents most likely to related, and then combined them into a prompt for completion.</p>

It’s also been raining heavily in the night and we have further calls about flooding in the road, so we ring Highways to inform them. I have a little smile to myself as I remember a call in the summer about cars stopping on the M11 because a mother duck and her ducklings were crossing the road. Lunchtime looms. I’m feeling hungry, but that disappears when I take a call from a 16-year-old male, who tells me that he can’t cope any more. He has cut himself with a knife but he doesn’t want to die. His sister has just had a baby. This goes on an emergency straight away, and officers are dispatched within three minutes. I have to talk to him about anything I can to distract him from his misery – luckily, I am good at small talk! Officers arrive and I feel relief as I can hang up the phone. COVID-19 has really affected Essex this year. People are low and weary. You can hear it in their voices. The number of mental health incidents has gone through the roof, and even the force control room team is quieter. Because of&nbsp;the onset of lockdown restrictions, more calls are coming in from the public reporting their neighbours for flouting the rules: 'We’re following the rules, why don’t they? What makes them think they are special?'&nbsp; Gone are the past calls about drunken people leaving the pub. Instead, we have members of the public who are tired of being tied to the house and resentful of those who ignore the restrictions. After lunch, we receive a flurry of calls. There’s a domestic, involving a woman who tells me that ‘he didn’t mean to hit me, he loves me’. I spend time with this caller. There are three horses in the road. A driver has hit a dog and is upset, so I reassure him it wasn’t his fault. It gets busier. Essex is up and running but I am not. I feel tired but this is my job, so I make sure that nobody will hear it in my voice. Finally, it’s time to go home and hang up the headset for another day. I tend not to reflect on my day too much, so I can have some time to myself. There is no typical day in the control room.

The vessel is identified as a rigid-hull inflatable boat (RHIB), which has four people on board wearing foul-weather gear and balaclavas. It appears to still have half a load of bales suspected to contain cannabis resin, wrapped in their distinctive blue and light brown hessian (approximately ¾ of a ton in total). Blue police beacons are engaged and the vessel has been repeatedly signalled to stop, but continues to carry out manoeuvres in an attempt to gain distance. The sea spray is cold and strikes the flesh like pins and needles. After a few minutes, which feel like an eternity, the pursuit is discontinued at the 3NM limits of territorial waters. CAD are informed and requested to inform Spanish Guardia Civil of the vessel’s last known speed and heading. No doubt it will return that night to attempt to unload its remaining cargo. I monitor the area and one of the crew observes something floating in the water. It is suspected to be a bale of cannabis resin, approximately 30-35kg in weight. It is retrieved and found to be in a good state with no marine growth. It is unclear whether it fell off the vessel recently pursued or belongs to a previous incident. The area is searched but nothing more is found. I return to GGMS, where I conduct a debrief. The bale is processed and conveyed to a police station for secure storage. I then complete the necessary paperwork, while the crew slip a zodiac out from the water, which was linked to the recovery of five North African migrants from the sea the previous day, and place the vessel on land. We continue with the mundane but necessary yard and vessel maintenance work. We grab a bite to eat, chat about the morning pursuit and joke about our recent mishaps. The work can be intense but we always manage to fill it with laughter. It’s now 2pm. The afternoon crew arrive. I give them a brief and handover. I then deploy on our training RHIB. As a qualified police instructor, I carry out powerboat training drills for the junior crew member. It reminds me of my early days at the helm and I enjoy passing on the knowledge. At 3.30pm, I return to base and carry out a debrief on the day’s activities. It’s the end of the shift. Let’s see what the next day brings – maybe another encounter with that RHIB.

The police will agree with the individual/family when they will next be contacted. This person should be provided with a call reference number and given details of how to contact the police with any further information they have about the case or if they would like to receive an update. An assessment must be made of the level of support required for the family, residential worker or foster carer and consideration should be given to appointing a family liaison officer. Information should then be provided regarding additional organisations that may be able to assist or support them.

It is also important to record the name and contact details of the person who gave that information and when this happened.

He is just about to finish for the day. As he walks down the street, he is approached by a man named Mark, who claims that he saw a man (named Steven) driving down a road not far from the location. Mark claims that he saw Steven drive into a cyclist, before driving off without stopping. Luckily, the cyclist was unharmed. The cyclist was named Kevin. Mark spoke to Kevin, and discovered that he is a 42 year old man, with a wife and two daughters.</span></span>

<pre><code>Context:
 First published 22 November 2016  Updated 15 March 2023   Latest changes  Written by College of Policing  Missing persons  30 mins read   Implications for the UK leaving the European Union are currently under review – please see&nbsp;APP&nbsp;on international investigation&nbsp;for latest available detail on specific areas, for example: Schengen Information System Europol INTERPOL Joint Investigation Teams This section provides additional information to aid the investigation based on the vulnerability of the individual and the circumstances in which they are missing. Missing children Safeguarding young and vulnerable people is a responsibility of the police service and partner agencies (see&nbsp;Children Act 2004). When the police are notified that a child is missing, there is a clear responsibility on them to prevent the child from coming to harm. Where appropriate, a strategy meeting may be held. For further information see: Voice of the child&nbsp; Voice of the child practice briefing&nbsp; Section 11 of the Children Act 2004 Department for Education (2014) Statutory guidance on children who run away or go missing from home or care Children’s Views on being Reported Missing from Care Young people and risky behaviour Children and young people often do not have the same levels of awareness or ability to keep themselves safe as adults. Going missing may indicate that something is wrong in their lives. Many of the children and young people who repeatedly go missing are considered by some to be ‘streetwise’ and able to look after themselves. However, these children may not understand the risk they are exposing themselves to, and should not be treated as low/no apparent risk simply due to their apparent willingness/complicity. Children&nbsp;may put themselves in danger because they may have been abused, neglected or rejected by their families or others and,&nbsp;as a result, they may engage in further risky behaviours, such as: misusing substances committing crimes having risky sexual contacts living on the streets mixing with inappropriate adults Information relevant to the child When a missing person report relates to a looked-after child, it is important to&nbsp;work with all the agencies and carers&nbsp;that&nbsp;have been&nbsp;in regular contact with the child as they&nbsp;may have information about the child that might help to locate them. When a child is missing from care, close engagement with the carers is important.

###

These include children or young people who: go missing&nbsp;– especially on regular occasions from home or care live in a chaotic or dysfunctional family have a history of domestic abuse within the family environment have a history of abuse (including familial&nbsp;child sexual abuse, risk of&nbsp;forced marriage, risk of&nbsp;honour-based violence,&nbsp;physical&nbsp;and&nbsp;emotional&nbsp;abuse and&nbsp;neglect) have experienced or are experiencing problematic parenting have parents who misuse drugs or alcohol have parents with health problems are young carers within the family unit experience social exclusion as a result of poverty have experienced recent bereavement or loss have unsupervised use of social networking chat rooms/sites have mental ill health have social or learning difficulties have low self-esteem or self-confidence are unsure about their sexual orientation or are unable to confide in their family about their sexual orientation misuse alcohol and/or drugs have been or are excluded from mainstream education are involved in gang activity attend school with other young people who are sexually exploited are friends with individuals who are sexually exploited do not have friends in the same age group are being bullied live in care, foster care, hostels and/or bed and breakfast accommodation – particularly when living out of their home area are homeless have associations with gangs through relatives, peers or intimate relationships live in a gang neighbourhood This is not an exhaustive list, nor have the vulnerabilities been listed in order of importance. Children from loving and secure homes can also be victims of sexual exploitation. The&nbsp;characteristics common to all victims are not always their age, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation, but their powerlessness and vulnerability. Warning signs Despite the increased profile of&nbsp;CSE&nbsp;and improvements in how the police work with partner agencies,&nbsp;CSE&nbsp;cases are still under-reported. The Office of the Children’s Commissioner conducted a two-year inquiry into child sexual exploitation in gangs and groups. Their 2013&nbsp;report,&nbsp;If only someone had listened, highlights that sexually exploited children are not always identified even when they show signs of being victims. Numerous warning signs were identified in the Office of the Children’s Commissioner 2012 interim report,&nbsp;I thought I was the only one, the only one in the world, which can indicate that&nbsp;a young person is being forced or manipulated into sexual activity and is a victim of sexual exploitation. Practitioners need to be aware of these warning signs and recognise that a victim does not&nbsp;have to exhibit all of the warning signs to be a victim of sexual exploitation.

###

Staff should tell the detainee that she can ask to see the carer at any time. Forces must implement policies and procedures to ensure that all girls who are detained and in custody are under the care of a woman. For further information, see&nbsp;PACE Code C, section 3.20A. Transporting children and young people Children and young persons under the age of 18 are not allowed to associate with adult detainees while being detained, conveyed to and from court or waiting to be so conveyed. An exception to this is permitted in accordance with the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 section 31, where the young person is jointly charged with an adult or relative. Officers should make arrangements to prevent association when the child or young person is: detained in a police station being conveyed to or from any criminal court attending court Children and young people should not be carried in a vehicle with adult detainees unless the vehicle has been designed and built to carry them separately and simultaneously. Vehicles that are available for this specific purpose are authorised under the 2011 Prisoner Escort and Custody Services’ contract arrangements. Appropriate adults Forces should establish policies and protocols to provide access to appropriate adults for young persons in police custody. Local YOTs have a statutory responsibility to ensure that an appropriate adult service is provided for children and young people, whether they provide the service themselves or contract a voluntary or private sector agency to do so on their behalf. It is the responsibility of the appropriate adult provider to work with the local force to develop policies and protocols to ensure there is effective provision of appropriate adult services in line with Youth Justice Board (2014) case management guidance. This guidance makes it clear that the appropriate adult service should operate out of hours as well as during standard working hours. All appropriate adults, custody managers, custody officers and staff must be aware of their role as defined by PACE, and also of any agreed local policies, protocols or service level agreements for providing appropriate adults. For further information, see PACE and section 38 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. See also the Youth Justice Board’s (YJB) National Standards for Youth Justice Services. The YJB and National Appropriate Adult Network have also published joint guidance and advice on appropriate adult services. When should an appropriate adult be contacted? Detention can be very stressful so it is important that an appropriate adult attends as soon as is practicable to minimise the amount of time the child or young person spends in detention.
